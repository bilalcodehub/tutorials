### Step 1: Delete the Existing Endoscopy Folder in CVAT

Before uploading the new fine-tuned models, we need to remove the existing `endoscopy` folder in the CVAT directory to ensure that the old models are not used.

Run the following command to delete the folder:

```bash
rm -rf cvat/endoscopy/
```

This ensures that any previous versions of the `endoscopy` models are cleared before we upload the updated models.

### Step 2: Copy Fine-Tuned Models to the Host

Once the fine-tuning process is complete, we need to copy the fine-tuned models from the MONAILabel Docker container to the host machine so that they can be uploaded to CVAT.

Run the following command to copy the app (along with the fine-tuned models) from the MONAILabel container to the CVAT folder on the host:

```bash
docker cp $(docker container ls | grep 'sweet_agnesi' | awk '{print $1}'):opt/monai/apps/endoscopy cvat
```

- **docker cp**: Copies files from a Docker container to the host machine.
- **$(docker container ls | grep 'sweet_agnesi')**: Identifies the MONAILabel container.
- **opt/monai/apps/endoscopy**: The path to the endoscopy app with the fine-tuned models inside the container.
- **cvat**: The destination folder on the host machine where the models will be copied.

After running this command, the fine-tuned models will be available in the `cvat/endoscopy` folder on the host machine.

### Step 3: Update CVAT with the Fine-Tuned Models

Now that we have the fine-tuned models on the host machine, we need to update CVAT so that it can use these models during future tasks. To do this, we will use a script that updates the models in Nuclio and CVAT.

Run the following command to update the model files in CVAT:

```bash
./cvat/endoscopy/update_cvat_model.sh tooltracking
```

This command:
- **./cvat/endoscopy/update_cvat_model.sh**: The script to update the CVAT model.
- **tooltracking**: The specific model being updated (in this case, surgical tool tracking).

This script will upload the fine-tuned model to Nuclio and update CVAT to use the new model for further tasks and annotations.

### What Happens Next

After running the above commands, CVAT will now use the updated fine-tuned models for any future annotation tasks. These models will be deployed via Nuclio, allowing for automated and improved annotation performance.

The active learning cycle can continue with the newly trained models, and MONAILabel will now be able to generate even more accurate predictions.

This concludes the process of uploading fine-tuned models to Nuclio. You are now ready to use these models for your surgical tool tracking tasks in CVAT!
