    "### Step 1: Installing Nuclio CLI (nuctl)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in integrating Nuclio with CVAT is installing the Nuclio CLI, called **nuctl**. This tool allows us to deploy and manage serverless functions directly from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the Nuclio CLI**:\n",
    "   Use the following command to download the latest version of Nuclio CLI (`nuctl`):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   wget https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/releases/download/1.13.12/nuctl-1.13.12-linux-amd64\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make the Nuclio CLI Executable**:\n",
    "   After downloading the binary, make it executable by running:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod +x nuctl-1.13.12-linux-amd64\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Move the Nuclio CLI to `/usr/local/bin`**:\n",
    "   To make `nuctl` globally accessible, create a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin`:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo ln -sf $(pwd)/nuctl-1.13.12-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/nuctl\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "   Verify that `nuctl` was installed correctly by running:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   nuctl version\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you're in the CVAT folder where the Nuclio CLI will be set up. You should run the following commands inside the CVAT directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd cvat\n",
    "```"
