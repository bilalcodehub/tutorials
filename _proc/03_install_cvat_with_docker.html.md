### Step 1: Clone CVAT Repository and Checkout to Version v2.7.5

To get started with CVAT, we need to clone the official repository and checkout a stable version (v2.7.5). This version includes the features we need for seamless integration with MONAILabel.

1. **Clone the CVAT Repository**:
   Open a terminal and run the following commands to clone the CVAT repository:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/opencv/cvat
   cd cvat
   ```

2. **Checkout the Stable Version**:
   After cloning the repository, checkout the stable version `v2.7.5`:
   ```bash
   !git checkout v2.7.5
   ```

   This ensures that you are working with a stable release of CVAT, compatible with the latest MONAILabel version.

### Step 2: Set Host and CVAT Version, Configure CVAT

Before starting CVAT, we need to configure the host IP and set the CVAT version in the environment variables. This step is essential to ensure that your CVAT instance can be accessed locally or from other devices.

1. **Set Host IP and CVAT Version**:
   Execute the following commands to set the host and CVAT version. You can use `127.0.0.1` if you're working locally.
   ```bash
   export CVAT_HOST=127.0.0.1
   export CVAT_VERSION=v2.7.5
   ```

### Step 3: Start CVAT Using Docker Compose

Now, we will use Docker Compose to launch the CVAT service along with Nuclio. CVAT is composed of multiple services, such as a server, UI, and machine learning model integration.

1. **Start CVAT with Docker Compose**:
   Use the following command to start CVAT. This will also enable serverless functionality via Nuclio:
   ```bash
   !docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml up -d
   ```

   This command pulls the necessary Docker images and starts all CVAT services. Make sure that ports 8070, 8080, and 8090 are available or modify the `docker-compose.yml` file if you need to use alternative ports.

2. **Create Superuser (Admin Account)**:
   After CVAT is up and running, we need to create a superuser account to manage the system. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   !docker exec -it cvat_server bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'
   ```

   This will prompt you to enter a username, email, and password for the superuser.

### Step 4: Access CVAT

Once CVAT is up and running, you can access it through a web browser.

1. **Open CVAT in Your Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or replace `127.0.0.1` with your host IP if different) in Chrome or another browser. You should see the CVAT login screen.

2. **Login**:
   Log in using the superuser credentials that you created earlier.

### Step 5: Troubleshooting and Configuration

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, here are a few common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Port Conflicts**: If any of the required ports (8070, 8080, or 8090) are already in use, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the port mappings, or stop any services that may be using these ports.

2. **Permissions Issues**: If Docker commands require root permissions, ensure that your user is part of the `docker` group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

3. **CVAT Service Not Starting**: Check the logs for any errors by running:
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_name>
   ```

### Next Steps

Now that CVAT is installed and running on your machine, you can start annotating medical videos and images. In the next tutorial, we will integrate CVAT with MONAILabel, allowing machine learning models to assist in the annotation process.
