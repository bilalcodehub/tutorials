    "\n",
    "To get started with CVAT, we need to clone the official repository and checkout a stable version (v2.7.5). This version includes the features we need for seamless integration with MONAILabel.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the CVAT Repository**:\n",
    "   Open a terminal and run the following commands to clone the CVAT repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   !git clone https://github.com/opencv/cvat\n",
    "   cd cvat\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Checkout the Stable Version**:\n",
    "   After cloning the repository, checkout the stable version `v2.7.5`:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   !git checkout v2.7.5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This ensures that you are working with a stable release of CVAT, compatible with the latest MONAILabel version."

    "\n",
    "1. **Set Host IP and CVAT Version**:\n",
    "   Execute the following commands to set the host and CVAT version. You can use `127.0.0.1` if you're working locally.\n",

    "### Step 3: Start CVAT Using Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will use Docker Compose to launch the CVAT service along with Nuclio. CVAT is composed of multiple services, such as a server, UI, and machine learning model integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start CVAT with Docker Compose**:\n",
    "   Use the following command to start CVAT. This will also enable serverless functionality via Nuclio:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   !docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml up -d\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command pulls the necessary Docker images and starts all CVAT services. Make sure that ports 8070, 8080, and 8090 are available or modify the `docker-compose.yml` file if you need to use alternative ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Superuser (Admin Account)**:\n",
    "   After CVAT is up and running, we need to create a superuser account to manage the system. Run the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   !docker exec -it cvat_server bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or replace `127.0.0.1` with your host IP if different) in Chrome or another browser. You should see the CVAT login screen.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you encounter any issues during the installation process, here are a few common troubleshooting steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Port Conflicts**: If any of the required ports (8070, 8080, or 8090) are already in use, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the port mappings, or stop any services that may be using these ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Permissions Issues**: If Docker commands require root permissions, ensure that your user is part of the `docker` group:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
