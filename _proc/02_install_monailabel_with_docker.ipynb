    "### Step 1: Pulling the MONAILabel Docker Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than installing MONAILabel via `pip`, we will pull the latest Docker image of MONAILabel, which includes all dependencies and tools pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pull the MONAILabel Docker Image**:\n",
    "   Open your terminal and run the following command to pull the MONAILabel Docker image:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   !docker pull projectmonai/monailabel:latest\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will download the latest MONAILabel image from Docker Hub. The image includes all the necessary libraries and tools required to run MONAILabel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify the Image**:\n",
    "   After pulling the image, verify that it has been downloaded successfully:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   !docker images\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You should see `projectmonai/monailabel` listed among your available images."

    "### Step 2: Running the MONAILabel Container with CVAT and GPU Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the Docker image has been downloaded, we need to run it with the appropriate volume mappings to ensure persistence of data, GPU support, and communication with CVAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run MONAILabel with GPU and Mapped Volumes**:\n",
    "   Use the following command to run MONAILabel, mapping both the `datasets` and `apps` directories, as well as enabling GPU support and communication with CVAT:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run -it --rm --gpus all --ipc=host --net=host \\\n",
    "       -p 8080:8080 \\\n",
    "       -p 8000:8000 \\\n",
    "       -v /home/exsdatalab/data/endo:/opt/monai/datasets \\\n",
    "       -v /home/exsdatalab/data/apps:/opt/monai/apps \\\n",
    "       projectmonai/monailabel:latest bash\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here’s a breakdown of the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `-it`: Runs the container in interactive mode with a terminal.\n",
    "   - `--rm`: Automatically removes the container after it stops.\n",
    "   - `--gpus all`: Allocates all available GPUs to the container for AI and machine learning tasks.\n",
    "   - `--ipc=host`: Shares the host’s IPC (inter-process communication) namespace with the container.\n",
    "   - `--net=host`: Shares the host’s network configuration with the container.\n",
    "   - `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container for CVAT.\n",
    "   - `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 on the host to port 8000 in the container for MONAILabel.\n",
    "   - `-v /home/exsdatalab/data/endo:/opt/monai/datasets`: Maps the local `datasets` folder to the container for persistent data storage.\n",
    "   - `-v /home/exsdatalab/data/apps:/opt/monai/apps`: Maps the local `apps` folder to store and modify MONAILabel applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access the MONAILabel Server**:\n",
    "   Once the container is running, you can access the MONAILabel server by opening a browser and navigating to:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   http://localhost:8000\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will bring up the MONAILabel interface, and CVAT can communicate with MONAILabel via port 8080 for machine learning-assisted annotations."

    "### Step 3: Downloading the Endoscopy App\n",
    "\n",
    "MONAILabel supports a variety of apps tailored to different medical tasks. The **Endoscopy Tool Tracking** app is one of the key applications used for tracking surgical instruments in endoscopic videos. We will download and prepare this app for use with MONAILabel.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the Endoscopy App**:\n",
    "   In your terminal, run the following command to download the Endoscopy app into the `apps` directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   !docker exec -it <container_id> monailabel apps --download --name endoscopy --output /workspace/apps\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Verify the App Download**:\n",
    "   After downloading, verify that the Endoscopy app is available in the `apps` folder:\n",
