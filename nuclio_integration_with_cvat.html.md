# Integrating Nuclio with CVAT for Serverless Function Management


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

### Step 1: Installing Nuclio CLI (nuctl)

The first step in integrating Nuclio with CVAT is installing the Nuclio
CLI, called **nuctl**. This tool allows us to deploy and manage
serverless functions directly from the command line.

1.  **Download the Nuclio CLI**: Use the following command to download
    the latest version of Nuclio CLI (`nuctl`):

    ``` bash
    wget https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/releases/download/1.13.12/nuctl-1.13.12-linux-amd64
    ```

2.  **Make the Nuclio CLI Executable**: After downloading the binary,
    make it executable by running:

    ``` bash
    chmod +x nuctl-1.13.12-linux-amd64
    ```

3.  **Move the Nuclio CLI to `/usr/local/bin`**: To make `nuctl`
    globally accessible, create a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin`:

    ``` bash
    sudo ln -sf $(pwd)/nuctl-1.13.12-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/nuctl
    ```

4.  **Verify Installation**: Verify that `nuctl` was installed correctly
    by running:

    ``` bash
    nuctl version
    ```

Make sure youâ€™re in the CVAT folder where the Nuclio CLI will be set up.
You should run the following commands inside the CVAT directory:

``` bash
cd cvat
```

### Step 3: Deploying Serverless Functions

With Nuclio installed and the dashboard running, we can deploy
serverless functions directly from the dashboard or using the `nuctl`
CLI. These functions can be integrated with CVAT to automate annotation
processes using machine learning models.

### Step 4: Integrating Nuclio with CVAT

In the next tutorial, we will demonstrate how to deploy a serverless
function to Nuclio and integrate it with CVAT for automatic video and
image annotation.
